# Traveling Salesman Problem
Project of the Graphs discipline, implementation in Python of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The Traveling Salesman Problem is a problem that tries to determine the shortest route to travel through a series of cities (visiting each one only once), returning to the city of origin. It is an NP-hard optimization problem inspired by the need for sellers to deliver to different locations (cities) in the shortest possible way, reducing travel time and possible transportation and fuel costs.

## Operation
To use the code, just run the main file and the dataset graphs will be processed and printed in the terminal. You must have Python 3+ installed.
